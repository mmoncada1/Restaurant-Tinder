# RestaurantSwipe - "Tinder for Restaurants"

A SwiftUI iOS app that helps users discover nearby restaurants through an intuitive swipe interface.

## Features

âœ… **Core MVP Features:**

- Swipe interface (left = skip, right = save to favorites)
- Configurable search radius (1-25 miles)
- Persistent favorites list
- Restaurant details with ratings, distance, and categories
- Location permission handling

ðŸŒ± **Additional Features:**
- Modern, responsive UI with smooth animations
- Tab-based navigation
- Detailed restaurant view with maps integration
- External links to Yelp and Apple Maps
- Mock data for testing (easily replaceable with live API)

## Architecture

**MVVM Pattern with Combine:**
- `@StateObject` and `@EnvironmentObject` for state management
- Reactive updates using `@Published` properties
- Clean separation of concerns

**Data Flow:**
1. `LocationManager` â†’ provides user coordinates
2. `RestaurantService` â†’ fetches restaurants from API
3. `CardStackView` â†’ displays swipeable cards
4. `FavoritesStore` â†’ persists liked restaurants

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Requirements
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+ target
- Swift 5.9+

### 2. Installation
1. Open `RestaurantSwipe.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your development team in project settings
3. Build and run on a physical device (location services required)

### 3. Yelp API Integration (Optional)
To use live restaurant data instead of mock data:

1. Get a Yelp Fusion API key from [Yelp Developers](https://www.yelp.com/developers)
2. Open `RestaurantService.swift`
3. Replace `"YOUR_YELP_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key
4. Uncomment the Yelp API call in `fetchRestaurants()` method
5. Comment out the mock data call

### 4. Testing on Device
The app requires location services and works best on a physical device. The simulator can be used with location simulation.

## Key Components

### Location Services
- Requests "When In Use" location permission
- Handles all authorization states gracefully
- Provides user-friendly permission prompts

### Swipe Mechanics
- Gesture-driven card interactions
- Visual feedback during swipes
- Configurable swipe threshold (150pt)
- Smooth animations and haptic feedback

### Data Persistence
- UserDefaults-based favorites storage
- JSON encoding/decoding for Restaurant objects
- Easy migration path to Core Data + CloudKit

### Restaurant Discovery
- Mock data service with realistic restaurant information
- Ready-to-use Yelp API integration
- Configurable search radius and filters

## Customization

### Adding Real API Data
The `RestaurantService` is structured to easily swap mock data for real API calls. Currently supports Yelp Fusion API but can be adapted for other services.

### UI Theming
All colors and styles use SwiftUI's adaptive system colors and can be easily customized through the Assets catalog.

### Enhanced Features
The architecture supports easy addition of:
- User authentication
- Cloud sync (CloudKit)
- Social features
- Advanced filtering
- Maps integration
- Push notifications
